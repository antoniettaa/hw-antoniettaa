# :sparkles: Welcome to my repository :sparkles:

#### This repository will store all of my projects for the _programming_ _with_ _data_ class with Dr. Wiernik
There are two branches you can travel to and easily switch between in this [repository](https://github.com/usf-progdata/hw-antoniettaa) 
* *Master* branch which stores _all_ projects
* *Homework* branch which stores _homeworks_ 

Every change made to my projects can be seen in the file's _history_ on the *top left*
